      My interpretation of the Rincewind character from the famous Discworld
      series. The painting is made during the reading of a book scene in virtual
      reality and imminently projected on the wall in the background. What you
      will see is what I can see in the headset in real-time!

      Interpretion of the two main characters of the classic Novel Life of Pi.
      They are surounded by rocks and a whale which is not particular a certain
      part of a the novel,but it gives the scene more drama. This painting is
      completely made in Google Tilt Brush.

      It’s such interesting and satisfying just to follow the painting strokes
      in three-dimensional space becoming the desired image. More and more the
      picture is revealed to the audience. More and more the artist takes us
      into his vision of the scene.
