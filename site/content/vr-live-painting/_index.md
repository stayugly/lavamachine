      My interpretation of the "Rincewind character" from the famous Discworld
      series. The painting is made during the reading of a book scene in Virtual
      Reality and immediately projected on the wall in the background. What you
      will see is what I can see in the headset in real-time!

      It’s such interesting and satisfying just to follow the painting strokes
      in three-dimensional space becoming the desired image. More and more the
      picture is revealed to the audience. More and more the artist takes us
      into his vision of the scene.
