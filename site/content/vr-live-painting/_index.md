      My interpretation of the "Rincewind character" from the famous Discworld
      series. The painting is made during the reading of a book scene in Virtual
      Reality and immediately projected on the wall in the background. What you
      will see is what I can see in the headset in real-time!

      They are surrounded by rocks and a whales which is not particular a
      certain part of a the novel, but it gives the scene more drama. This
      painting is completely made in Google Tilt Brush.

      It’s such interesting and satisfying just to follow the painting strokes
      in three-dimensional space becoming the desired image. More and more the
      picture is revealed to the audience. More and more the artist takes us
      into his vision of the scene.
