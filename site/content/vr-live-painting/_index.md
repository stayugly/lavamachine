    My interpretation of the Rincewind character from the famous Discworld
    series. The painting is made during the reading of a book scene in virtual
    reality and imminently projected on the wall in the background. What you
    will see is what I can see in the headset in real-time!

    It’s such interesting and satisfying just to follow the painting strokes in
    three-dimensional space becoming the desired image. More and more the
    picture is revealed to the audience. More and more the artist takes us into
    his vision of the scene.
