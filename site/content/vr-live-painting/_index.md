  headline: Author Reading – “Discworld”
  text: >
    My interpretation of the Rincewind character from the famous Discworld
    series. The painting is made during the reading of a book scene in virtual
    reality and imminently projected on the wall in the background. What you
    will see is what I can see in the headset in real-time!

  headline: Life Painting – "Life of Pi" Interpretation
  text: |
    Interpretion of the two main characters of the classic Novel Life of Pi.
    I'm not sure if they were ever surounded by rocks and a whale. 
    I thought it would give the scene more drama an makes it more interesting. 
    This painting is completely made in Google Tilt Brush.
