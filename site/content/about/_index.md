  text: >-
    Within our film making, design and illustration background we 
    always had one common philosophy: “Story is King”. We know only the right 
    and well told story will trigger emotions and transfer your message to your 
    audience. Since 2017 we were specialized in Virtual Reality to take this craft 
    to the next level.
