  text: >-
    Within our film making, design and illustration background we always had one
    common philosophy: “Story is king”. We know that only the right and well
    told story will trigger emotions and transfer YOUR message to YOUR 
    audience. Since 2017 we were specialized in Virtual Reality (VR) to take
    this craft to the next level.
