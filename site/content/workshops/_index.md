    We arrived in the future. A new profession has emerged: the VR artist. As
    established 3D animation filmmakers, we have studied the topic intensively
    and know that it is extremely easy to learn.

    If you have enough of the theory and just want to get started, then visit us
    at our hands-on booth. True to the motto learning by doing, we want to take
    you to the various methods of virtual illustration by the hand.

    2. Feb. - VR Skulpturenbau, VHS Düsseldorf
