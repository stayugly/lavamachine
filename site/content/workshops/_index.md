    We arrived in the future. A new profession has emerged: the VR artist. As
    established 3D animation filmmakers, we have studied the topic intensively
    and know that it is extremely enjoyable to learn.


    Just like the motto learning by doing, we want to show various methods of
    virtual painting and animation.
