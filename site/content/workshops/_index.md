    We arrived in the future. A new profession has emerged: the VR artist. As
    established 3D animation filmmakers, we have studied the topic VR
    intensively and know that it is extremely enjoyable to learn.


    During a one day workshop we want to show you the various techniques and
    methodes of virtual painting and animation.
