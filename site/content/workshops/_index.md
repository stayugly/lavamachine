    We arrived in the future. A new profession has emerged: the VR artist. As
    established 3D animation filmmakers, we have studied the topic VR
    intensively and know that it is extremely enjoyable to learn.


    During our workshops we want to show you the various techniques and methodes
    of virtual painting and animation.
