    My Workingspace. Entirely made in Virtual Reality. I used a spherical
    photograph of my room as reference background and modeled everything onto
    it. I was scared a couple of times because I saw myself taking a photo
    behind me. In VR everything is a bit confusing at first..

      A little boy dives deep into solving of the Rubiks Cube until he isn't
      aware of time and his surroundings anymore.  “Time Machine” is the first
      short film with more complex character animation, backgrounds, music
      composition and sound design. The animation was entirely produced in
      Virtual Reality too.

      People often ask Eric what it is like to be a cyborg…. So, he made this
      short infographic with AnimVR in Virtual Reality about “Cochlear
      Implants”.  He also  wants to remind people and filmmakers that subtitles
      are very welcome for the 70 million deaf people out there.
