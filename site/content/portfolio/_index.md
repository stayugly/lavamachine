    Made with AnimVr in Virtual Reality. Fun to do. I used a spherical photograph of my room as background and modeled everything onto it. I was scared a couple of times because I saw myself taking a photo behind me....in VR everything is a bit confusing ... I had to project it onto a sphere because of the file size limit of Sketchfab, but still interesting piece even without stereoscopic.
