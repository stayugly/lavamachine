video_one:
  headline: Time Machine
  text: >
    A little boy dives deep into solving of the Rubiks Cube until he isn't aware
    of time and his surroundings anymore.  “Time Machine” is the first short
    Film with more complex character animation, backgrounds, music composition
    and sound design. The animation is completely produced in Virtual Realty
    (AnimVR, Quill).
video_two:
  headline: Atelier

    Made with AnimVr in Virtual Reality. Fun to do. I used a spherical
    photograph of  my room as background and modeled everything onto it. I was
    scared a couple of times  because I saw myself taking a photo behind
    me....in VR everything is a bit confusing ... I had to project it onto a
    sphere because of the file size limit of Sketchfab, but still interesting
    piece even without stereoscopic.
video_three:
  headline: A Cochlear Implant - Infographic
  text: >
    People often ask Eric what it is like to be a cyborg…. So, he made this
    short  infographic with AnimVR in virtual reality about “Cochlear Implants”.
    He also  wants to remind people and filmmakers that subtitles are very
    welcome for the  70 million deaf people out there.
