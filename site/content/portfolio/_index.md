      A little boy dives deep into solving of the Rubiks Cube until he isn't
      aware of time and his surroundings anymore.  “Time Machine” is the first
      short film with more complex character animation, backgrounds, music
      composition and sound design. The animation is completely produced in
      Virtual Realty (AnimVR, Quill).

      Made with AnimVr in Virtual Reality. Fun to do. I used a spherical
      photograph of  my room as background and modeled everything onto it. I was
      scared a couple of times  because I saw myself taking a photo behind
      me....in VR everything is a bit confusing ... I had to project it onto a
      sphere because of the file size limit of Sketchfab, but still interesting
      piece even without stereoscopic.

      People often ask Eric what it is like to be a cyborg…. So, he made this
      short infographic with AnimVR in virtual reality about “Cochlear
      Implants”.  He also  wants to remind people and filmmakers that subtitles
      are very welcome for the  70 million deaf people out there.
