      A little boy dives deep into solving of the Rubiks Cube until he isn't aware of time and his surroundings anymore.  “Time Machine” is the first short film with more complex character animation, backgrounds, music composition and sound design. The animation is completely produced in Virtual Realty (AnimVR, Quill).

    headline: Atelier
    text: > 
      Made with AnimVr in Virtual Reality. Fun to do. I used a spherical photograph of  my room as background and modeled everything onto it. I was scared a couple of times  because I saw myself taking a photo behind me....in VR everything is a bit confusing ... I had to project it onto a sphere because of the file size limit of Sketchfab, but still interesting piece even without stereoscopic.

      People often ask Eric what it is like to be a cyborg…. So, he made this short infographic with AnimVR in virtual reality about “Cochlear Implants”.  He also  wants to remind people and filmmakers that subtitles are very welcome for the  70 million deaf people out there.
